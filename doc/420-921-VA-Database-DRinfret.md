## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of database design and database
development. Using a relational database management system (RDBMS), students
will learn to define, manipulate, and query a database. This course covers
relational databases and the entity-relationship (ER) model, along with the
Structured Query Language (SQL). In addition, students will learn how to
establish data confidentiality (management of authorization), to process data
(stored procedure and scripts), and to save and restore a database.

## Course's role in the program

This course introduces students to database concepts, design, and
implementation. It emphasizes various features of a database management system.
The fundamentals learned in this course will be vital for the students’
development throughout the program. This is a prerequisite course to the
*Application Development 1: Desktop* course given in the third semester, and its
content will be used and applied in almost all of fourth- and fifth-semester
courses.

## Statement of course competencies

The competency **00Q7 Use a database management system** will be covered
completely in this course.

## Course-level Learning Outcome

Students will contribute to a team-based database project that includes
designing and implementing a real-world database, based on a data model and
specification. Students will define and implement the database, load data to
populate the tables, and write appropriate SQL queries to retrieve data and to
answer relevant business questions.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Use a database management system :

- Element 1: Create the database.
- Element 2: Formulate read requests, insertion requests, modification requests
  and deletion requests.
- Element 3: Ensure data confidentiality and consistency.
- Element 4: Program automated data processing operations.
- Element 5: Save and restore the database

## Required reading material (Textbook)

There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture notes will be
provided through Omnivox, along with a list of recommended readings and
tutorials. The list will be updated throughout the course as needed.

### Late work

A 10% penalty for each late day will be applied on assignments submitted
after the deadline. The project (LIA) and the exam cannot be submitted late.
Exceptions can only be granted only according to the College policies and
procedures.

## Project (Learning Integration Assessment)

A large project that is performed in groups of 2 or 3 students that makes use of
the main concepts and practices covered in this course allows students to design
and implement a real-life database. Based on a data model and specifications,
students would define and implement the database, populate tables, and write
appropriate SQL queries to retrieve relevant information.

*Examples*: A project could be based on a database for a school, car-rental
agency, hotel, library, human-resources department, banking accounts, etc.

- Provide a conceptual model in the form of ERD including attributes, their
  types, and constraints on them
- Identify any constraints that are not captured by the ERD
- Translate the conceptual model into a relational schema
- Implement the relational schema in SQL
- Write SQL statements to alter a table and its constraints
- Write SQL statements for data manipulation (insert, update, and delete)
- Write appropriate queries to retrieve data
- Write triggers/checks to maintain data integrity.
- Produce the required documents (spool files, script files, project reports,
  etc.)

### Evaluation criteria for the learning integration assessment

The following criteria are considered in the evaluation of the project
deliverables:

- Design:
    - Appropriate topic and scope
    - Correct representation of the real-world problem
    - Appropriate tools and notation
- Implementation:
    - Correct SQL scripts to create the database
    - Correct demonstration of queries on the database
- Documentation:
    - Correct presentation of work completed
    - Correct demonstration of database usability
- In the presentation, clear communication of
    - Project objectives, need addressed, and target user-base.
    - Difficulties met in the project and solutions.
    - Lessons learned.

### Deliverables

- Deliverable 1: Project proposal
- Deliverable 2: Project Design and implementation
- Deliverable 3: Project report and presentation

### SPLI

The quality of English expression will be evaluated and be worth 10% of
the total as part of grading the LIA written reports and in-class
presentations.

## Teaching Methodology

Programming exercises and discussion on sample programs can take place
either during the lecture time or lab period. All meetings will be held
**online** at the time of the scheduled classes using Zoom, through the link
provided on Omnivox.

## College policies & Procedures

There is a set of College policies and procedures covering the rights and
responsibilities of both faculty and students. These cover grade review,
student-faculty mediation, sexual harassment, standing and advancement,
cheating and plagiarism, absences for religious holidays.

Note that students who observe religious holidays during the semester must

## Respecting Privacy during Synchronous Online Classes

The instructor might proceed for recording the student's image and voice in the
context of online synchronous lectures or labs class. Students will
be asked for their permission and agreement through form or MIO. The
recording will only be available to other students in the group through and will
be deleted once the block has ended.

## Respecting Intellectual Property Rights in Online Classes
