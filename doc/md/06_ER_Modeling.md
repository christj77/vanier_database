# Entity-Relationship Modeling

- *Relational data model* (or *relational model*)
- *Entity-Relationship Model* (or *ER Model*)
- Examples

## Relational Model

- **Relation (table)**: 2-dim table, set (not list) of tuples
- **Attributes**: table columns, fields
- **Schema**: Movies(title, year, length, filmType)
- **Tuples**: rows in the table, records
- **Domains**: types

### Example Table from a World Database

#### Table: **country** (sample data, sorted by country name)

![example table](../images/relational_table.png)

### Terminology (1)

- **Entity**: Something of interest to the database user community.
    - customers, parts, geographic locations
- **Column**: An individual piece of data stored in a table.
- **Row**: A set of columns that together completely describe an entity or some
  action on an entity. Also called a record.
- **Table**: A set of rows, held either in memory (nonpersistent) or on
  permanent storage (persistent).

### Terminology (2)

- **Result Set**: Another name for a nonpersistent table, generally the result
  of an SQL query.
- **Primary Key**: One or more columns that can be used as a unique identifier
  for each row in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: One or more columns that can be used together to identify a
  single row in another table.

## Steps to create a new database

1. **Conceptual** and **Logical Models**: model (or design) the database at the
   *conceptual* and *logical* level
    - we can use the traditional **ERD** notation, or
    - the **UML** notation, or
    - some other notations [notation.md](..%2Fdiagrams%2Fnotation.md)
    - the *conceptual* model is very general, like a first draft, focusing on
      entities and relationships only
    - the *logical* adds data types and constraints to the *conceptual model*


2. **Relational Data Model**, aka the **Physical Model**: convert the logical
   model into the relational data model
    - we could use other data models, such as the *object-relational* model or
      other non-relational models (OO, NoSQL models, ...)
    - the relational model is the most common model, and it cannot be skipped or
      ignored when learning about databases

3. **Database Instance Creation**: generate the necessary `CREATE TABLE` and
   other SQL statements to create a database
   instance, and fill it with data

- After the database has been created, you can start using it (`SELECT`
  statements, data updates, ...)

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

#### Traditional notation

- **Entity sets**: rectangles
- **Relationship sets**: diamonds
- **Attributes**: ovals
- **Arrow heads** for connecting relationship sets to entity sets:
    - *solid black triangle*: at most 1
    - *open round* or *transparent triangle*: exactly 1
    - no arrow heads: many
- **Primary keys**: underlined attribute names

#### UML notation

[notation.md](..%2Fdiagrams%2Fnotation.md)

- **Entities**: rectangles
- **Relationships**: lines between entities, possibly with labels and
  directional arrows besides the labels
- **Attributes**: in the entity rectangles, below the entity names
- **Cardinalities** for connecting relationships to entities:
    - *at most 1*: `0..1`
    - *exactly 1*: `1` or `1..1`
    - *many*: `*`
    - *at least 1*: `1..*`
- **Primary keys**: attributes with constraint `<<pk>>`
- **Foreign keys** (in the physical diagrams only): attributes with
  constraint `<<fk>>`
- **Not null** constraint: circle before the attribute name

### Simple Bank Database

- The database application called BANK, which keeps track of a Bankâ€™s customers
  and their accounts.
    - Customers are identified by their name, address, phone and customer ID.
    - Accounts have numbers, types (e.g., savings, checking) and balances.
    - Also record the customer(s) who own an account.
    - A transaction takes place on exactly one account.
    - Each transaction has an ID, a code, an amount, a date, a time and a
      description.

### College Database

- In this database, you have to record students, lecturers, courses, grades and
  student advisers.
    - Every student has a student number, a name and an address.
    - Every lecturer has an employee number, a name, an office room number, a
      rank and a phone number.
    - For each course, its code, name and number of credits are recorded.
    - A grade is given to a student by an lecturer for a course taught during a
      semester (A, B, or C) of a particular
      year.
    - Student's advisers are lecturers.

### Music Copyrights Database

- You are asked to design a music copyright collection agency database,
  including information as follows:
    - A writer has a writer number, first name, last name and address.
    - Writers may be signed with a publisher. Publishers sign up many writers.
    - Publishers have a publisher code, name and address.
    - Writers write works. Works may have more than one writer. Each writer
      writes a percentage of a work.
    - A work has a title, duration and description.
    - Works get performed at concerts (or music shows) by an act.
    - A concert has a date and a venue.

### Apartments for Rent

- You have to design a database to manage the information of a company managing
  a set of apartments for rent.
    - This company manages many buildings, each consisting of at least one
      apartment.
    - Suppose that an apartment can be uniquely identified by its number within
      its building.
    - For each apartment, there is at least one tenant, if it is rented.
    - The monthly rent and the end-of-lease date (if known) must be included.
    - For each apartment available soon, the date of availability and the asking
      monthly rent must be included.
    - For each tenant, the first name, last name, the home phone number, the
      name of his/her employer and his/her work
      phone number must be included.

- This end-of-lease date is not always the day after the end of the previous
  lease because an apartment could be
  unavailable for some time because of renovations, for example.
- Following a similar reasoning, the asking monthly rent is not necessarily the
  same as the current rent.
